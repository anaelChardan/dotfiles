# My Dotfiles!

I'm using debian with i3wm as windows manager.

- Alacritty as terminal with zsh inside tmux.

To reproduce my config you need:
- "oh-my-zsh" with "punctual zsh" theme.
- i3lock fancy multimonitor for locking your computer

I'm using some GUI to manage some basic things:
- For FileSystem -> SpaceFM
- For Wifi -> wicd
- For Bluetooth -> Blueman
